# git-env

Create and manage your own development environments on top of your existing team projects.

## Premise

Git repositories usually have environment specific settings ignored and as such are not checked in. When developing as part of a team, each developer often has their own environment, such as editor settings etc.

## Solution

git-env adds the ability to manage environments that sit "on top of" existing git repositories.
